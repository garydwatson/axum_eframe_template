This project is mostly a clone of eframe_template, but with an axum backend wired in and an example of how to get the two to talk to one another...

With this template you can start building real web applications with egui without any fuss...

Right now this project is a bit of a mess because I'm still cleaning it up and getting it ready so that people can easily use it as a real template...  That effort will take awhile, however you can already use this project to springboard you into a working egui interface and an axum backend that talk to each other... The rest is just building endpoints and gui elements, wiring them together, and getting whatever you can imagine built :)

This readme will also improve as time wears on, I thought it better to just get this out there in case somebody wanted to use it.
